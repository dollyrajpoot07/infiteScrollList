# Infinite Scroll List (React / Next.js)

This utility demonstrates an infinite scroll pattern using React hooks and Intersection Observer. It fetches data from the [JSONPlaceholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts) in paginated form and auto-loads more posts as the user scrolls down.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Auto-loads 10 posts per scroll
- Uses `IntersectionObserver` to detect scroll bottom
- Displays loader and end message
- Real API integration
- Reusable and minimal design

## ðŸ§ª How to Run

1. Clone or copy this project
2. Run `npm install`
3. Start with `npm run dev`
